		<p>Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and computer gaming, coined the term “Machine Learning”.
		He defined machine learning as – “Field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.
		In a very layman manner, Machine Learning(ML) can be explained as automating and improving the learning process 
		of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance. 
		The process starts with feeding good quality data and then training our machines(computers) by building machine learning models using 
		the data and different algorithms. The choice of algorithms depends on what type of data do we have and what kind of task we are
		trying to automate.</p>
